boring
======

Static site generator written in go.

# What does it do?

It takes the markdown, and puts it in the HTML!

## Example

`boring markdown/ templates/ static/`

This will take the markdown files in `markdown` and render them with
the templates in `templates/`, puking all the output to `static/`.
